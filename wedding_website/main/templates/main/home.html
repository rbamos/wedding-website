        <h2 class="mb-4">Alice & Bob: A Love Story</h2>
        <p>
            Alice and Bob first met at a cryptography conference in 2018. Their shared passion for secure communication quickly turned into a deep connection. 
            Over the years, they've worked together on numerous projects, from decoding puzzles to encrypting their love in every way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <strong>2022</strong>, Bob proposed to Alice in the most secure way imaginableâ€”by encrypting his proposal in a custom algorithm only Alice could decode. 
            Needless to say, she cracked the code and said yes!
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, Alice and Bob have built a life full of trust, laughter, and a shared love for solving problems. They are excited to celebrate their next big 
            adventure with all of you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you can attend or not, thank you for being part of their story. Your support has been the key to their happiness.
